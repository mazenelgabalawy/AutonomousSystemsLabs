    Visualizes the grid map, tree structure, and the path from start to goal, with optional vertex labeling.

    Parameters:
    - gridmap (2D array): The grid map representing the environment, where `0` indicates free spaces and non-zero values represent obstacles.
    - start (tuple): The (row, col) coordinates of the start position.

    - show_vertcies (bool): If True, displays vertices with their indices. Default is False.

    Returns:
    - None: This function generates a visual plot but does not return any value.

    Notes:
    - The grid map is visualized using `matshow`, providing a background of the environment.
    - Tree edges are drawn as white lines between parent and child nodes.
    - The given path is shown as a series of red lines connecting the nodes in the path.
    - Start and goal positions are marked with distinct symbols (`r*` for start and `g*` for goal), and labeled in the legend.
    - If `show_vertcies` is True, each vertex in the tree is marked with a green plus sign (`+`), and its index is displayed next to it.
    - A legend is included to distinguish between the start and goal positions.

        Procedure:
        1. Initialize the tree with the start node as the root (no parent) and set the cost of the start node to 0.
        2. Iteratively:
            - Sample a random point (`qrand`) from the grid using `sample_random_point`.
            - Find the nearest vertex (`qnear`) to `qrand` in the current tree using `nearest_vertex`.
            - Steer toward `qrand` from `qnear` to generate a new point (`qnew`) using `get_qnew`.
            - Check if the segment between `qnear` and `qnew` is obstacle-free using `is_segment_free`.
            - If valid:
                - Add `qnew` to the tree, assigning its parent to minimize cost, and update its cost.
                - Rewire the tree by checking if the cost of neighboring nodes can be reduced through `qnew`.
            - If `qnew` coincides with the goal and the goal is reached for the first time:
                - Save the current tree and path, and record the cost and iteration number.
        3. After all iterations:
            - If the goal is in the tree, reconstruct the optimized path and return it with its cost.
            - Otherwise, return an empty path and infinite cost.

        Notes:
        - The maximum number of iterations is defined by `self.max_iter`.
        - The step size for tree expansion is controlled by `self.dq`.
        - Rewiring optimizes the cost by reassigning parent nodes within a specified distance (`self.max_search_distance`).
        - The path reconstruction is performed using `reconstruct_path`.
        - A path is considered found when `qnew` coincides with the goal node.
